# The weather app

This application was developed by Nikita Shevyakov as a test project in order to gain the necessary skills for technology ownership:

- `react`
- `react-redux`
- `redux-saga`
- `local storage`

## Acceptance Criteria

- weather by current location (weather now + weather for the next 24 hours)
- the page should be able to search for weather for a particular city (all cities)
- weather for which you searched should be in a separate list, with the ability to delete items from this list (the list of cities stored in local storage).
- by clicking on a city from the list, the weather in that city should be displayed (error handling on the UI (any server errors, you can pop-up, or something where there will be an error)).
